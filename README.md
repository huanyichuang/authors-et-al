# authors-et-al
This plugin will enable you to select multiple authors for the single posts, and can choose special layouts to display the authors' names.

The idea came from [Every Author as First Author](https://github.com/edemaine/author-stack-paper) by [Erik D. Demaine](https://erikdemaine.org/) and [Martin L. Demaine](http://martindemaine.org/).

## To-dos
- [ ] Fetch the user if the author is also the WordPress user.
- [ ] Style updates with the styles provided.
- [ ] i18n support.
- [ ] Reconsider the scenarios and make better compatibilities.
- [ ] Code clean up.
